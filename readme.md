JavaScript Programming Exercises
Exercise 1: Determine Age and Residential Area
Write a program that defines a variable representing the age of a person and prints a message based on the age range. Additionally, add a variable representing the residential area and print a message based on both age and residential area.

Part 1:
If age is less than or equal to 18: "You are a kid"
If age is between 18 and 65: "You are an adult"
If age is 65 or older: "You are a senior citizen"
Part 2:
If the person is a senior citizen from the CENTER area: Print "You are a senior citizen"
If the person is a young citizen from any other area: Print "You are an adult 18-65"
Otherwise: Print "NO COMMENT"
Example:

Age 17, area CENTER: "NO COMMENT"
Age 25, area NORTH: "You are an adult 18-65"
Age 66, area CENTER: "You are a senior citizen"
Age 18, area CENTER: "NO COMMENT"
Exercise 2: Check Divisibility by 3 and 4
Write a program that defines a variable representing a number and prints whether the number is divisible by 3, by 4, or by both.

Output Messages:
If the number is divisible by 3: "Can be divided by 3"
If the number is divisible by 4: "Can be divided by 4"
Hint:
You can use the modulo operator % to check divisibility.

Exercise 3: Check String Length
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the length of the string is greater than 5 characters, otherwise returns false.

Exercise 4: Check Even or Odd
